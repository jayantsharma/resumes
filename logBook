- Trip Summary (official) 

This 21-day trip leader course covered 77 kms in the Kumaon Himalayan Region in Uttarakhand State. This group was composed of 12 students and 2 instructors, and finished the expedition together with no injuries or evacuations. We gained over 7600 metres of elevation with both on and off trail hiking, exposed ridgelines and down to the forested valley bottoms. The students learned how to manage a group on steep terrain and possible rock fall zones. The group crossed 6 passes, without significant river crossings. The weather was blissfully sunny and pleasant until the last major hiking day when we expreienced mountain weather with rain, sleet, and hail.

We hiked and summitted two hill-tops. The curriculum emphasized backcountry living and travelling skills, backpacking, risk management and decision-making, learning the NOLS leadership model, and how to plan and lead backcountry trip of their own in the future. The group camped in beautiful meadows, learned outdoor baking, and each member became an LNT trainer. We watched the glory of the mountains, spotted wildlife, and ate brownies over the golden sunsets. Every sunrise brought us a new challenge and learnings as we saw exotic birds hovering over our camps.
