### Personal Profile
I am a skilled, confident outdoorsman having spent considerable time backpacking and mountaineering in the Indian Himalayas. I've displayed a strong sense of trustworthiness, punctuality, reliability, sensitivity and interpersonal skills while leading outdoor groups. I completed the Trip Leader course organised by NOLS India which helped me polish my leadership and communication skills. I'm smart with a keen analytical mind and am a quick thinker. 
As a member of the football team since high-school, I imbibed crucial lessons in man-management and motivational skills.
